# Bit and Byte

`bit` is binary digit.
`byte` equal `8 bits`.

Some of based number:
+ `binary` (base-2) (electrical devices)

`zero-width joiners` or `ZNWJ characters` which mean glue the emoji on the left to the emoji on the right.

`CS Trivia` or `Computer Science Trivia` refers to the question of fun fact related to Computer Science.

These `trivia questions` can cover a wide range of topics within the field, including programming languages, algorithms, data structures, computer history, hardware, famous computer scientists, and other interesting or lesser-known facts about technology. `CS Trivia` is often used in quizzes, games, or as a fun way to learn and engage with computer science topics.

# Image

`image` is a grid of `pixel`

`pixel` stands for `picture element`. Each `pixel` contains 24 bits which is 3 bytes.

An `image` is usually around 3mb, which is 3 megabyte (million byte), which is 1 million `pixel`.

# About me

My name is Hao Lam, and I am a college student currently pursuing a degree in IT at VNUHCM-US.

This space is for me to store notes about my university coursework and online courses that I plan to watch later. It helps me build a second brain and allows me to access my materials from anywhere.

# Workflow

My general workflow involves the use of `Obsidian`, where I write and organize my notes using markdown syntax, which allows for easy formatting and structuring information. After having prepared my notes, I transform them into HTML with `Quartz` - a static site generator powered by `Jekyll`. This means my notes become web-friendly and will be prepared for publishing. Finally, I use `GitHub Actions` to automate the process of deploying my site so that my notes become accessible online.
